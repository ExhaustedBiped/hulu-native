# Hulu Native
 A PyQt WebEngine window running the Hulu site in its own window.

This app was written in python and uses PyQt WebEngine to render the site. (Thus, you will need PyQt, which can be installed with `pip install pyqt`)

I didn't work with Hulu on this, thats why I had to use a generic h from the internet. This is part 2 of my "make sites run in 'native' apps project."

## TODO:
- Make it load faster?
- Add settings?
